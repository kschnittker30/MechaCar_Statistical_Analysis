  * The vehicle_length and ground_clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset since their p-values were less than 0.05.           
  * The p-value of the linear regression analysis is 5.35 x 10-11, which is much smaller than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.
  * This linear model does not predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the mulitple R-squared is 71.49%. This indicates that 71.49% of the variablity of the dependent value is explained by this linear model.  There are other factors not included in the model that also affect the mpg of MechaCar.
